	<h1>CaniSat</h1>
	<p>
		We are a community coalition with the mission to advance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_radio_service" target="_blank">SDARS</a> technology in the USA and Canada, now and into the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		By creating free and open-source management and data visualization software, CaniSat provides greater choice for subscribers to receive crucial information.
	</p>
	<p>
		These efforts pick up from previous development and reverse-engineering efforts for controlling aftermarket serial devices such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_PCR" target="_blank">XM PCR and XM Direct</a> to now also expand to the SXV, XMWX, among other data-inclusive SDARS hardware.
	</p>
	<p>
		CaniSat software strives in providing a transparent standard for subscribers to view and listen to information that would otherwise only be managed using proprietary and restrictive software ecosystems.
